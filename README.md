This repository contains some implementations of custom deep learning layers and models using the Keras submodule of Tensorflow 2.

Some initial implementations are:

1. Custom DNN: Custom deep neural network with 3 hidden and 1 output layers. The number of units in each hidden layer and in the output layer are provided by the user
